### Lesson 11

In this lesson, you create a front end for the Jobs API you created in the previous lesson. Front ends may be created in various ways, for example using React, and they may run in various environments, such as an app for a smart phone. The front end for this lesson is created using just HTML and JavaScript. It runs in a browser, and is loaded from the same Express instance as the API it calls. That is, you will be creating “server-rendered” pages.

**There is no video for this lesson. Instead, there are detailed instructions in the Assignment section.**

**Note:** This lesson appears to be mostly copy/paste — but it may not be depending on what you did the last few weeks! You create forms and tables, but if you used a data model different from Job, as was recommended in lessons 9 and 10, you must modify the HTML and JavaScript so that the forms, tables, and JavaScript variables match your data model. This may seem like a lot of work, and perhaps it is, but once you have completed it, if you used a data model different from the Job model used by the instructor (or you at least substantially extended that model) then you are well on your way to completing your class final project.
